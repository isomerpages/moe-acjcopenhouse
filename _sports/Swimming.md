The Anglo-Chinese Junior College Swimming Team holds the honour of maintaining high standards of performance and adherence to our college values, Integrity, Tenacity and Passion. The ACJC Swimming Team has represented the College well through the years (3rd overall placing at National Schools Games Swimming Championships 2019) with many high points when our own swimmers broke records and brought home medals and championship trophies to grace our trophy cabinets.

  

More precious however, are the memories we have made together. This CCA ensures that every member has the opportunity to grow to be the best swimmer they can be regardless of prior experience. Our coaches and teachers are highly experienced and fondly regarded, as they not only cater to our performance and skill needs but support our personal aspirations to honour our college through our efforts. As such, we welcome every swimmer, experienced and otherwise, to join our CCA. Our training sessions are thrice weekly and you will not want to miss any of them because the bonds made within our family of swimmers are forged and deepened by time spent together on common goals.

  

Come, join us. Be part of our team, our family of swimmers.
