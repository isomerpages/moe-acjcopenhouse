Our canoeing team believes in the saying, “Live a legACy, Leave a legACy”. We aim to pass on the life lessons, values and traditions taught to us by our seniors to our juniors. In the same way our seniors have shared their experiences with us, we want to continue to uphold this heritage by passing it down to many batches of canoeists to come. The ACanoe team has not only fostered excellent teamwork and synergy, but they have also been awarded many achievements as a result of their hard work. Thanks to the dedication of all canoeists, both of our A Division girls and boys managed to clinch the third place for the past two seasons in 2018 and 2019 while in 2017, our A Division girls emerged as champions.

  

One of the reasons for people choosing Canoeing, is to try something different and rare, whilst making the most of their JC experience. Most people who join have no prior experience, but the rigour and intensity of our training help us to improve quickly. Our training sessions are frequent and definitely tough, but it is through these tough experiences that we build a sense of teamwork, camaraderie and community.

  

The canoeing team will willingly welcome any potential ACanoeists with open arms and open hearts! So what are you waiting for? Come join us today in ACJC!
