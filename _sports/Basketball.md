The ACJC Basketball team is diverse and consists of committed individuals who complement their skills and talents on the court with good qualities and attitudes off the court. The vigorous skills and physical trainings have all contributed to everyoneâ€™s growth, not only as individual players but also as a single system working together to achieve success greater than what we as individuals can accomplish.

  

ACJC Basketball has strengthened our passion for Basketball, and pushed the boundaries of our perceived physical and mental limits. We have picked up important soft skills such as communication, teamwork and leadership, learnt how to work with different talents and backgrounds, and developed our character as a student, a friend and a teammate. To us, ACJC Basketball is family. <i>- Harie Hafeez Khairuddin, Vice-Captain</i>
