In 2022, we are thrilled that our Softball Captain (2020/2021), G Solai Valli, is awarded the prestigious President Scholarship. Throughout the 2 years with us, she showed strength not just physically and mentally but also in her character. Surviving and thriving at each and every grueling softball training sessions, she supported her team mates who are struggling and was a strong pillar to them. Solai truly exemplify our college value of tenacity and passion!
