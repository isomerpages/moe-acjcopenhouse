**The College’s vision is for students to be engaged learners**&nbsp;\- responsible for their learning, energised by their own learning, and forming a collaborative learning community with their teachers and peers. We want to equip students with the skills and attitudes for success in the 21st century.

  

To achieve these aims, the college offers the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-level curriculum taught over a two-year academic programme. The A-level curriculum seeks to develop higher order thinking skills – primarily application, analysis, evaluation and synthesis. In addition, it develops skills in communication, project management, research, and scientific process work. The curriculum offers a wide range of subjects at three differentiated levels – H1, H2 and H3. This enables students to achieve a breadth of coverage across various disciplines, as well as customisation to suit their own preferences and chosen career paths.

  

In line with the college’s vision of engaged learning for its students, in which students take responsibility for their own learning, students are offered a free choice of subjects, taking into account the MOE prescribed standard. Introductory lectures, subject counselling and university admission requirements are provided to enable students to make an informed choice of the subjects they wish to offer. H3 subject selection will take place at the end of the JC1 year.

  

Students must adhere to the MOE prescribed standard of at least 3 H2, 1 H1 content subjects (of which at least one must be a contrasting subject), General Paper, Project Work, and Mother Tongue Language (unless they qualify for an exemption). Some examples of subject combinations illustrating the contrasting subjects are shown below.
