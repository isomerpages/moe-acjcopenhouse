Pixel Labs is a club that helps contribute to the school by creating videos and posters for various events and occasions such as National Day, Open House and CCA Promotional videos. Students who are part of the club are able to gain firsthand experience in thinking out of the box to draw up storyboards, engineer interesting shots and stitch together different sequences to create a cohesive and enthralling video. Furthermore, as we have to work closely with different groups ranging from students to teachers, members of the Pixel Lab will be able to learn communication skills that are used in the working world. Students who are interested in filming, video editing or wish to pick up a skill (video-editing) that will be able to give them a competitive edge in the workforce should definitely consider joining the club.
