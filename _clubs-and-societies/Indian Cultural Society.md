During our weekly meetings, the Indian Cultural Society works to preserve Indian culture by carrying out a wide variety of activities including Tamil Debate, Drama and Singing.Â  Through our community outreach projects as well as our internal and external performances, we ensure the continued appreciation and deeper understanding of Indian Culture both within the club, and throughout the student body.
