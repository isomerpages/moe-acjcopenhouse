### History Society

Did Sang Nila Utama really see a Lion when he discovered Singapore? Many questions like these are discussed at the ACJC History Society (HISSOC). We aim to inculcate a greater passion for history in our members through the appreciation of the past by connecting the lessons learned from it to current realities.

To this end, a main staple of every HISSOC session involves roundtable discussions, where members will present and hold discussions on any historical topic of their choosing. From Genghis Khan and the Mongolian empire, Julius Caesar and the Roman Republic, to Lenin and the Soviet behemoth. Through these discussions, members are able to share their love and passion for the subject. Of course, the learning and enjoyment of History is also expanded beyond the classroom.

  

HISSOC carries out Values in Action (VIA) activities such as the 2022 Dover Heritage Trail, where we brought students from Fairfield Methodist Secondary School on a field trip around the Dover region. Moreover, we also participate in enrichment activities such as creating documentaries for Total Defence Day, where we explained the foreign threat which brought about Singaporeâ€™s largest mobilisation of the army. In short, if you desire a place where you are able to learn and share history with a tight-knit group of friends, HISSOC is the place for you!
