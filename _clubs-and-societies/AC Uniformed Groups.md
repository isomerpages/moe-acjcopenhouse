AC Uniformed Groups (ACUG) is a family where members from all Uniformed Groups come together to share their cultures and experiences, whilst learning about the cultures and experiences of other UGs. We organise college events such as Total Defence Day and National Day Celebrations for the student body to enjoy and learn more of Singapore's culture. In addition, members also return to their secondary school units to help out in trainings in efforts to nurture the next batch of leaders. These fruitful hours may also be registered for VIA hours at ACUG.

  

Join us as we work through this pandemic to bring new activities for the CCA to foster even stronger bonds with one another such as to develop a stronger esprit de corps!
