‘Service Above Self’. This is the motto for the Interact Club of ACJC. This motto which is based on Rotary International’s goals has been a guiding mantra for our Interactors to keep serving others. Our firm belief in this motto can be seen in our weekly volunteering at various VWOs such as MWS Bethany Nursing Home, mYMCA’s M.Y. Big Sweep and kidsREAD program with PCF Yuhua. In addition, we also carry out various club events. These include festive celebrations such as Chinese New Year Cheer at Bethany and Easter Egg Hunting with Beyond Social Services @ Delta, Kids’ Day Out with Wishing Well and #OOTB (Out-of the-book) with PCF Yuhua. In addition to these, we also organise ‘Come Walk in My Shoes’, an in-house workshop based on role-playing for VIA representatives aimed at empathy-building.

  

Through such events, not only do our Interactors get to contribute back to society, but they also engage in purposeful planning of these activities and the logistics in implementing these events. As an encouraging testimony to the Interactors’ contribution, the Interact Club of ACJC has also been awarded the ‘Presidential Citation for Interact Clubs’ for two years in a row. This award is given by Rotary International for Interact Clubs worldwide.
