<center><h4>Science and Mathematics Council</h4></center>

The Science and Mathematics Council provides opportunities for students to develop their aptitude and potential in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) through critical thinking.

We engage ACJC-students through experiential learning science workshops, Master-Classes and learning journeys, and plan and execute our annual international-scale science competitions each with 1000+ participants, such as the International C. B. Paul Science Quiz, the International Biomedical Quiz, for secondary and pre-university students; and the Heyday, a social-enrichment programme for 150 primary school students with Autism Spectrum Disorder though science, art and music explorations.&nbsp;

<center><h4>Biomedical Club</h4></center>

The Biomedical Club aims to develop students’ passion for Biology and Medical Science.

We partner the Science and Mathematics Council in question-setting for international competitions, organise the Peer-Support Groups and conduct Biology-related workshops to enrich ACJC students’ knowledge. These experiences have deepened our knowledge on medicine as well as on biological sciences. In addition, months of intensive gruelling training by international Olympiad medallists and teachers prepared us to compete successfully in the International Biomedical Quiz, and the Singapore Biology Olympiad. Our research projects at the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair, and the Green Wave Environmental Care are mentored by researchers and teachers.

<center><h4>Mathematics and Computing Club</h4></center>

The Mathematics and Computing Club aims to develop students’ passion for Mathematics and Computer Science.

We partner the Science and Mathematics Council in question-setting for international competitions, organise Peer-Support Groups and conduct Mathematics- and Informatics-related workshops, such as introductory coding and Minecraft workshops to develop an interest and aptitude in ACJC students towards coding. With months of intensive training by international Olympiad medallists, we have also had the opportunity to take our passion for Mathematics, Computing and Engineering to a higher level by participating we competed successfully in the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, and the Singapore National Olympiad of Informatics. We have the opportunity to embark on Mathematics-Computing related research projects to participate in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair.
