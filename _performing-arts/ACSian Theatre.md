ACSian Theatre is the prize-winning Drama Club of ACJC, a West Zone Centre of Excellence for the Language Arts. Our CCA’s members learn a range of performance skills with our various productions throughout the school year. While some students have prior drama experience, many members enjoy the process of learning performance skills from scratch.

  

In 2022, we staged A Midsummer Night’s Dream (a prose adaptation of Shakespeare’s comedy), The Fall of Icarus (physical theatre) for the Singapore Youth Festival and were awarded the Certificate of Distinction, Mulan (Chinese martial arts), and a re-telling of Cinderella (dance and text). For our performance of A Very Sad Comedy of Young Pyramus and Thisbe, we were awarded a Gold Medal at the International Theatre Festival Online 2022.
