Founded in 1977, the Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) Concert Band develops the musical talents of every student to his or her fullest potential. New to music-making? Fret not! We welcome members who do not have prior knowledge or musical background too. ACBand believes that all have potential that will be nurtured â€“ be it in terms of musical abilities, leadership skills or creativity. Through the strong support of our alumni and dedication of our conductor, Mr. Alvin Seville, we continually pursue musical excellence. Furthermore, ACBand is more than just a band, it is a family where we always spur each other on and look out for each other!
