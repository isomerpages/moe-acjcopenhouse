‘Steadfast in duty, healers with passion.’  
  

Looking to be an inspirational first-aider who could save someone’s life? Well, this CCA would be the one for you! The essence of first aid is that it is immediate, and your actions could well change the trajectory of someone’s journey to recovery. Your timely actions could make you someone’s angel in their time of peril. Eager to learn how to benefit others, as well as yourself? Then, join our First Aid Unit!

  

Be it a burn or a sprain, our First Aid Unit will always be the support and healers of the College. Serving as one Unit, our first aiders have always provided our unwavering assistance to our fellow ACsians in a vast majority of the College’s main events, such as the annual Open House, RunAC, Inter-House Games and AC Games every year. As a service CCA, we also extend our support to our community as we facilitate the annual College-wide Blood Donation Drive alongside the Singapore Red Cross. But don’t worry, you will first be undergoing a fun and exciting First Aid Course to become a certified First Aider! :)

  

Despite the difficulties brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Unit has persisted in its duties to educate our new first aiders and ensure that we are still equipped with the necessary theory and knowledge to serve the College. We train to gain, we train to serve, and we also train to compete! In the annual Inter-Junior College First Aid Photoquiz, we clinched 1st place in the Team rankings and 3rd place & merit in Individual in 2018, and 2nd in Individual rankings in 2019. Sadly, due to COVID-19, Photoquiz 2020, 2021 and 2022 were missed. Thus, we invite you to join us and our Unit for Photoquiz 2023!
