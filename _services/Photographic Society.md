Ever wanted to ace your way around the camera (and try out really cool, high end photography equipment?

ACJC's Photography Society is a service CCA that encourages members to put their photography skills and creative talent to good use by capturing all exciting moments in AC from Orientation to National Day!

Event coverage aside, we also impart photography skills and knowledge in weekly training sessions that will expose you to the diverse world of photography while giving you multiple platforms to hone your skills such as a vast&nbsp; array of competitions.

We also organise an annual Film Workshop, where you can be exposed to the fascinating world of film photography and even learn how to develop your own film roll in our ACJC Dark Room!&nbsp;

So what are you waiting for? Join us and be part of our family in 2022! Do check out our instagram @acjc\_photography for more updates/information!
