Media Resource Crew (MRC) is a tight-knit crew that produces many of the school’s various online and offline mass-scale events and occasions such as Open House, Orientation, SG Perspectives and many more. We are a highly versatile CCA, equipped to adapt to situations as they present themselves. Crewmates learn how to think on their feet to solve immediate technical problems ranging from sound to multimedia. As one of the school’s service CCA, we work closely with the other CCAs and teachers, and crewmates will be able to polish their interpersonal skills that are crucial in the real world.

  

MRC is a relatively small CCA which allows you to bond with all your crewmates, where none is left out in this CCA. Anybody, even beginners, would quickly be able to find their place in this CCA. We accept all regardless of skill or knowledge. Students who are interested in running live events, picking up a hard or soft skill, or just want to be in a student-centric yet productive CCA should definitely consider joining our crew. MRC welcomes all!
