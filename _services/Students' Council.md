### Serving with unity, Leaving our legacy

The 46th Students’ Council comprises like-minded, passionate individuals united by our hearts for service. This is a space where we create ideas, initiatives and events to enhance the ACJC experience for our peers, as well as beloved members of the ACJC family. Closely knitted by four sub-committees - CCA, College Welfare, Public Relations and Sales, each of us serve in different areas, interweaved with different strengths by our common goal to serve the school.&nbsp;

  

While the 46th Students’ Council takes charge of student events, working closely with our teachers and the school administration, we also push out initiatives to improve student welfare and impact the wider community. Beyond the things that we do and the roles we assume, the Students’ Council is a tight-knit family that aims to exemplify the fun-loving, passionate, and tenacious spirit we hope to see in our ACJC.&nbsp;

  

More than just a group of student leaders, we are legacy makers - sparking change and empowering others to make a difference.
